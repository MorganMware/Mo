        <h1> <u>PROJECT IDEA</u></h1>
        <p><b>My project idea is to Combat the spread of pests by identifying critical intervention areas and efficient targeting control interventions.
            With the use of GIS tools, I aim to offer opportunities for cost-effective and efficient targeting of interventions and control. In monitoring, GIS can be used to determine the spatial extent of a disease, to identify spatial patterns of the disease and to link the disease to auxiliary spatial data. 
            GIS can also be used to predict the projected spatial spread of diseases, to provide input for risk assessment models in pest control and in quantifying changing thresholds of pests and diseases due to climate change. </b>
